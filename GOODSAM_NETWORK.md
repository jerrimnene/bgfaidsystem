# üïäÔ∏è GoodSam Network - Good Samaritan Help System

## Overview

The **GoodSam Network** is a complete humanitarian + faith response system integrated into the BGF Aid Platform. It's a modern, digital incarnation of the Good Samaritan parable - connecting people in distress with real helpers (pastors, counselors, nurses, volunteers) instantly, 24/7.

### Vision
When anyone in Zimbabwe needs prayer, counseling, food, or emergency aid, they can reach out instantly ‚Äî and the GoodSam Network alerts real helpers nearby. No one is left unseen.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Three Layers of GoodSam

#### **Layer 1: Frontline Connection** 
The "Need Help Now" page - open to everyone. It's the visible face where anyone can say "I need help" and choose what kind.

#### **Layer 2: Backend Intelligence**
The engine that receives requests, stores them, and alerts responders. Powered by PostgreSQL database with real-time notifications.

#### **Layer 3: BGF Dashboard**
Inside your staff/admin portal, see:
- Incoming GoodSam requests (live)
- Who responded (pastor, elder, staff)
- Follow-up reports
- Weekly impact stats

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Responders not receiving notifications
- **Solution**: Check `goodsam_responders` table for `is_verified = true` status
- Verify responder's `availability_status = 'available'`

**Problem**: Help requests not being created
- **Solution**: Ensure user is authenticated (has valid token)
- Check database connection and schema exists
- Verify required fields are provided

**Problem**: Dashboard showing no stats
- **Solution**: Run `GET /api/v1/goodsam/dashboard/stats`
- Check database has help requests
- Verify user has admin role

---

## üìû Support & Development

For questions or issues:
1. Check the database schema in `backend/database/schema.sql`
2. Review controller logic in `backend/src/controllers/goodsamController.ts`
3. Check frontend pages in `frontend/src/app/goodsam/`
4. Review API responses in frontend network calls

## üôè Theological Foundation

"A lawyer stood up to test Jesus. 'Teacher,' he asked, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?'...

Jesus replied: 'A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.'"

**The GoodSam Network embodies this principle**: Seeing those in need, stopping to help, and following up on their recovery. In the digital age, through your BGF platform.
